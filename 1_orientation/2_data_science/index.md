# Introduction to Data Science in R

This is the repository for a day-long intensive crash-course on data science in R. Data science is rarely cut-and-dried; each analysis typically provides answers but also raises new questions. This makes the data scientific process fundamentally cyclical:

The course aims to familiarize students with the major stages of the circle of data science. The first part of the training covers data preparation and exploratory analysis, including import, data preparation/cleaning, and data visualization. The second part is an in-depth case study that reinforces these skills and introduces elementary statistical modeling methods in the context of answering a complex question using a real-world data set. 

## Preassignment

Prior to the session, you must complete the [preassignment](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/preassignments/preassignment1/index.html). This is a set of instructions to install necessary software and ensure its proper functioning. 

## Session Materials

The best way to interact with the materials is to `git clone` the repository, but you can also course access individual materials through the links below.
