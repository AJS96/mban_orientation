# Introduction to Data Science in R

This is the repository for a day-long intensive crash-course on data science in R. Data science is rarely cut-and-dried; each analysis typically provides answers but also raises new questions. This makes the data scientific process fundamentally cyclical:

During orientation, we will focus on the tidying, transforming, and visualizing of data. These steps comprise what is often called Exploratory Data Analysis. We will also introduce RMarkdown as a convenient, flexible tool for communicating both code and analysis findings. 

## Session Materials

The best way to interact with the materials is to `git clone` the repository, but you can also course access individual materials through the links below. 


## Exploratory Data Analysis in `R`

Slides introduce some key concepts, while almost all coding work happens in the linked scripts.

## Literate Programming with R Markdown

We will step through `example_report.rmd` below to see how examples like these are constructed.
