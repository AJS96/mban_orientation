# Session Outline

## Introduction (20 mins)

- Data science is the practice of **asking impactful questions** of a data set,  **choosing appropriate methods** by which to answer those questions, and **implementing** those methods in practical fashion. 
- In order to do data science, we need to navigate the cycle of data science. 
- `R` helps us do that. 
- Outline of the day. **This is going to feel fast, and you are not going to get everything** -- and that's ok!
- Students grab partners.
- Opening scripts in RStudio.
	+ Point to source editor, console, and environment pane. 
	+ Students should have open `wrangle_viz/student_script.R` and `wrangle_viz/dashboard.Rmd`. 
	+ Hello, World: `print("Hello, World")`	


**BREAK** (3 mins)

## Wrangling (60 mins)

- Why EDA? EDA is getting to know your data: like a date, you'll do better if you get to know each other first.

**BREAK** (7 mins)

## Dashboard exercise (50 mins)

- Introduce exercise, emphasize creative component. 
- Students should formulate an approach to the question asked, and design analyses to answer it. 
- **This is question time**. Want to try something? Just ask us!! 


## Total Time Allotted: 207 mins

- Contingencies: Scale back wrangling exercises, give them some head-start code on joins.
