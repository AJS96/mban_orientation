    "**Sudoku** is a number puzzle played on a 9x9 grid. The challenge is to place a digit between 1 and 9 inclusive in each empty cell, such that the completed grid obeys the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each row contains the numbers 1 to 9 once and only once.\n",
    "* Each column contains the numbers 1 to 9 once and only once.\n",
    "* Each 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers 1 to 9 once and only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most natural formulation of this problem would probably be something like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{i,j} \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is of course something we can do with integer programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 \\leq x_{i,j} \\leq 9, ~ integer$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge now is the constraints. One observation is that the numbers 1 to 9 add up to 45, so we could try something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{j=1}^9 x_{i,j} = 45 $$\n",
