    "# Facility Location Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem involves transporting supply from facilities to consumers, for example shipping products from factories to retail locations. Let there be $M$ customers and $N$ facilities. Each customer $i = 1, \\ldots, M$ needs to be shipped $f_i$ units, and each facility $j$ has the capacity to produce $b_j$ units. The cost of transporting one unit of supply from facility $j$ to customer $i$ is given by $d_{ij}$, the distance between them. Our goal is to transport the goods from the facilities to the customers at minimum cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The twist is that none of these facilities have been built yet, and we can only build $K$ facilities in total. Goods cannot be shipped from a facility that is not build. This means we also need to decide which facilities to build in order to deliver the goods at minimal cost.\n",
