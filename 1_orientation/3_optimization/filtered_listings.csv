I am a jewelry designer/stylist living and working in NYC. 
I love to travel, and in my ventures, I find that clean, hospitable, well-kept and well-designed accommodations can sometimes make or break the trip. That's why when I was introduced to Airbnb, I was intrigued and chose to sign up and join the family and community.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Downtown,Chinatown,NA,Boston,MA,02111,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35055,-71.06169,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,5,1,2,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox}",NA,294,NA,NA,$100.00,$69.00,4,$15.00,2,1124,2,2,1124,1124,2,1124,2 days ago,TRUE,6,32,57,324,2019-07-14,180,36,2015-11-02,2019-06-23,93,9,9,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,4,882,882,882,TRUE,TRUE

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Chinatown,Downtown,NA,Boston,MA,02116,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35169,-71.06419,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,1,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Elevator,""Indoor fireplace"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Host greets you""}",NA,202,NA,NA,$100.00,$49.00,2,$15.00,2,1124,2,2,1124,1124,2,1124,2 days ago,TRUE,11,41,61,132,2019-07-14,108,44,2016-09-14,2019-06-27,92,10,9,9,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,3.13,767,747,NA,TRUE,TRUE

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy
