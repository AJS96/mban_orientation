# Introduction to Data Science in R
*Instructors: Phil Chodrow and Colin Pawlowski*

This is the repository for a day-long intensive crash-course on data science in R. Data science is rarely cut-and-dried; each analysis typically provides answers but also raises new questions. This makes the data scientific process fundamentally cyclical:

The course aims to familiarize students with the major stages of the circle of data science. The first part of the training covers data preparation and exploratory analysis, including import, data preparation/cleaning, and data visualization. The second part is an in-depth case study that reinforces these skills and introduces elementary statistical modeling methods in the context of answering a complex question using a real-world data set. 

# Prerequisites

This training does not require any specific theoretical background. However, all students are expected to complete the [preassignment](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/preassignment/preassignment.html) prior to the session.
