## Questions for Today

> 1. What is data science?
> 2. What are the stages of the data scientific method? 
> 3. How can we perform those stages using the `R` statistical programming language?

## "Big Data" $\neq$ Data Science

> *The key word in "Data Science" is not "Data", it is "Science"* 
- [Jeff Leek, Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/2013/12/12/the-key-word-in-data-science-is-not-data-it-is-science/)

> *The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.*
- John Tukey

*Data science* is the science of answering **interesting or impactful questions** using **suitable data** for those questions. 


## What Skills Do We Need?

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width = "400px", out.height = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5150aec6e4b0e340ec52710a/t/51525c33e4b0b3e0d10f77ab/1364352052403/Data_Science_VD.png?format=1500w')
```

## The **data-scientific method** is the method by which we deploy these skills to conduct data science.

# Hello, R

## Why Not Spreadsheets? {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, out.height = "440px", out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics('http://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/tables/excel-table.png')
```

- **Flexibility:** Can you do the analysis you want?
	- Limited statistics
	- No contemporary ML
	- Limited visualizations
- **Reproducibility:** Can you share it with others, including future you?
	- Platform limited 
	- Can't version control
	- Difficult to inspect code
- **Scalability:** Can you do it quickly on large data sets? 
	- Excel can handle ~1M rows

</div>


## Why Statistical Programming? {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, out.height = "500px", out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics('http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/images/notebook-demo.png')
```

- **Flexibility:** Can you do the analysis you want?
	- "There's a package for that"
	- Access to cutting-edge methods
	- Custom analysis and visualization
- **Reproducibility:** Can you share it with others, including future you?
	- Cross-platform, often FOSS 
	- Can version-control with `git`
	- Easy to inspect code
- **Scalability:** Can you do it quickly on large data sets? 
	- `R` and `python` can work with ~10M rows easily, lots of solutions for larger data sets

</div>

## Why `R`?

```{r}
# knitr::include_graphics('https://www.activestate.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_image/public/r-vs-python-blog.jpg?itok=SHOP2mku')
```

- `R` is **the best** language in the world for **learning** data science.
- `R` is **one of the best** languages in the world for **doing** data science. 
- `R` tends to be preferred in academia and among "statisticians," while `python` is more popular among "computer scientists" and "data scientists"
- Most practicing data scientists know and use both. 

## Some Cool `R` Tricks

- [Literate Documents](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_nyt_home_price/)
- [Interactive Dashboards](http://jkunst.com/flexdashboard-highcharter-examples/pokemon/) with Shiny
- [Blogs and Websites](https://philchodrow.github.io/post/2017-06-19-info-segregation-2/)
- These [slides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html) are written in `R`

## Learning Goals for Today

> - You are not going to become an `R` expert in one day
> - But...
> - You will know the **basic concepts** and **vocabulary** of data science -- enough to employ the most important skill of all. 

## The most important skill...

```{r, out.width = 750, out.height = 450}
knitr::include_graphics('http://www.logika.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Data-Science-Education-at-Monash-Monash-University.jpg')
```

## The most important skill:

```{r, out.height = 500, out.width = 650}
knitr::include_graphics('http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2010/05/delete_facebook-500x438.png')
```

## Today's Gameplan

1. **Data Wrangling and Visualization in `R`** (2.5 hrs)
2. **Mini-Project, Part 1** (1 hr)
3. **Lunch** (1 hr)
4. **Statistical Modeling and Analysis in** `R`
5. **Mini-Project, Part 2** (1 hr)

## Exercise 0

> 1. Look left.
> 2. Look right.
> 3. Pick a partner (groups of 3 are fine). 
> 4. Give them a professional, yet friendly smile. 
> 5. You are going to need them soon.
