# Introduction

1. The Data Science Process
2. The Case
3. The Tidyverse

## The Process of Data Science

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width = "700px", out.height = "300px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png')
```


## What We'll Do This Morning

> - Ask an impactful question. 
> - Generate some candidate answers using real data.
> - Create a simple business intelligence (BI) [dashboard](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/wrangle_viz/dashboard.html) to guide decision-makers. 

## The Case

- AirBnB is a website that allows hosts to rent their homes to travelers and tourists. 
- AirBnB can maximize its business by ensuring it has enough listings in different neighborhoods. 
- AirBnB has asked you, a data analytics consultant, to help them identify neighborhoods in Boston where they should focus on recruitment through advertising and incentives. 
- They have given you a complex, multi-part data set to answer this question. 

## FYI: Base `R` and the Tidyverse

- `R` without any packages offers ways to do most of the things we will see today. 
- But base `R` is not a very good programming language. 
- We will use the Tidyverse, a set of packages that promote code which is 
	1. Easy to write and read
	2. Highly performant
	3. Consistent through the data scientific process

# Getting Started

1. Data Import and Inspection
2. Data Subsetting
3. The Pipe

## Exercise 0 

> 1. Look left.
> 2. Look right.
> 3. Pick a partner. 
> 4. Give them a professional, yet friendly smile. You are going to need them soon. 

# Case Study, Part 1

1. Load libraries
2. Import and inspect the data
3. The Nicest Places in JP
4. The Biggest Places in Back Bay

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
listings <- read_csv('../data/listings.csv')
calendar <- read_csv('../data/calendar.csv')
```

## The Pipe

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 200, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d21ii91i3y6o6h.cloudfront.net/gallery_images/from_proof/3632/small/1419844831/magrittr.png')
```

> - `x %>% f(y)` $\Longleftrightarrow$ `f(x,y)`
> - "Take `x`, and **then** do `f(...,y)` to it"
> - `x %>% f(y) %>% g(z)` $\Longleftrightarrow$ `g(f(x,y),z)` 

## Some Simple Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# familiar
listings %>% glimpse()  # = glimpse(listings)
listings %>% head()     # = head(listings)
listings %>% colnames() # = colnames(listings)

# get all columns with "review_scores" in the column name
listings %>% select(contains('review_scores')) 
# what should this return? 
listings %>% select(contains('review_scores')) %>% colnames()
```

# Summarising Data

1. Summary Statistics
2. Adding Columns
3. Grouping

## Data Summaries

- You should usually summarise your data before turning on the fancy algorithms -- sometimes the story is clear. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 600, out.height = 300}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/graphics/minard_lg.gif")
```
*Napoleon's March, by Charles Minard*

## Summaries the Tidy Way

- `data %>% mutate(new_col = formula(old_col1, old_col2)` creates new columns.
- `data %>% group_by(col)` groups data for breakout summaries.
- `data %>% summarise(measure = formula(col1, col2))` computes summary statistics.
- `data %>% group_by(col) %>% summarise(measure = formula(col1, col2))` computes summary statistics by levels.

Let's test these out in the case study. 

# Keeping Current

1. More practice with `filter` and `summarise`
2. `join`ing data

## How Current Is This Info?

```{r}
calendar %>% 
	summarise(earliest = min(date), 
		   latest = max(date))
```

Pretty current. But some of these listings may be "zombies" without recent availability. How can we include only listings with availability in the last three months? 

## The Approach

1. Operate on the `calendar` table (exercise)
2. `join` that information to the `listings` table (together)
3. Filter the listings table accordingly (together)

## Relational Data

The information we need is distributed between two tables -- how can we get there? 

We need a key that tells us which `calendar` rows correspond to which `listings`. 

> `listings$id` corresponds to `calendar_listing$id`

## `join` 

The `join` family of functions lets us add columns from one table to another using a key. 

- `x %>% left_join(y)`  : most common, keeps all rows of `x` but not necessarily `y`.
- `x %>% right_join(y)` : keeps all rows of `y` but not necessarily `x`.  
- `x %>% outer_join(y)` : keeps all rows of both `x` and `y`
- `x %>% full_join(y)` : keeps only rows of `x` that match in `y` and vice versa. 

We'll use `left_join` for this case. But first, the exercise! 

# Getting Visual

1. Graphical Excellence
2. The Grammar of Graphics
3. `ggplot2`

## Graphical Excellence {.smaller}

> Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data -- a matter of *substance*, of *statistics*, and of *design*. Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. -- *Edward Tufte*

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 350}
knitr::include_graphics("http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/51bb6d7ceab8ea9113000017-1410-959/detroit%20property%20tax%20delinquency.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 350}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/images/0003Cs-8047.GIF")
```

</div>

## The Grammar of Graphics

A **grammar** is a set of components (ingredients) that you can combine to create new things. Many grammars have **required components**: if you're missing one, you're doing it wrong. In baking....

<div class="columns-2">

- **A body** -- typically some kind of flour)
- **Binder** -- eggs, oil, butter, or applesauce
- **A rising agent** -- yeast, baking soda, baking powder
- **Flavoring** -- sugar, salt, chocolate, vanilla

```{r, out.height = 200, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/pictures/640x422/pastry-1-web.jpg")
```

</div>

## The Grammar of Graphics

- Puts the `gg` in `ggplot2`. 
- Formulated by Leland Wilkinson.
- Implemented in code by Hadley Wickham, now part of the `tidyverse`

<div class="columns-2">
```{r, out.height = 400, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZIHtc9TJL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg")
```

```{r, out.height = 400, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://pix-media.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/1001/HadleyObama2.png")
```
</div>

## Ingredients of a data visualization {.smaller}

- **`Data`**:  almost always a `data_frame` 
- **`Aes`**thetic mapping: relation of data to chart components.
- **`Geom`**etry: specific visualization type? E.g. line, bar, heatmap?
- **`Stat`**istical transformation: how should the data be transformed or aggregated before visualizing?
- **`Theme`**: how should the non-data parts of the plot look?
- Misc. other options. 

`+` plays the same role in `ggplot2` that `%>%` does in data manipulation.

## First Plot {.smaller}

Does getting **lots** of reviews usually mean you get **good** reviews? 

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 600}
listings %>% 
	ggplot()
```

## First Plot {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 600}
listings %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating)
```

## First Plot {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 600}
listings %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating) + 
	geom_point()
```

## First Plot {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 600}
listings %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating) + 
	geom_point(alpha = .2) 
```

## First Plot {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 600}
listings %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating) + 
	geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
	theme_bw()
```

## First Plot {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	### <b>
	filter(number_of_reviews < 100) %>%
	### </b>
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating) + 
	geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
	theme_bw() 
```

## First Plot {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	filter(number_of_reviews < 100) %>%
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating) + 
	geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
	theme_bw() + 
	labs(x='Number of Reviews', y='Review Score', title='Review Volume and Review Quality') 
```

## First Plot {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	filter(number_of_reviews < 100) %>%
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating) + 
	### <b>
	geom_point(alpha = .2, color = 'firebrick') + 
	### </b>
	theme_bw() + 
	labs(x='Number of Reviews', y='Review Score',title='Review Volume and Review Quality') 
```

## Changing Aesthetics {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	filter(number_of_reviews < 100) %>%
	ggplot() + 
	### <b>
	aes(x = review_scores_value, 
		y = review_scores_location, 
		size = number_of_reviews) + 
	### </b>
	geom_point(alpha = .2, color = 'firebrick') + 
	theme_bw() 
```

## As a Heatmap {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	filter(number_of_reviews < 100) %>%
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = review_scores_value, 
		y = review_scores_location, 
	### <b>
		fill = number_of_reviews) + 
	geom_tile() + 
	### </b>
	theme_bw() 
```

## Exercise 6

The following code computes the average price of all listings on each day in the data set:
```{r, warning = FALSE}
average_price_table <- calendar %>% 
	mutate(price = price %>% gsub('\\$|', '',.) %>% as.numeric()) %>% 
	group_by(date) %>% 
	summarise(mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Use `geom_line()` to visualize these prices with time on the `x`-axis and price on the `y`-axis. 

## Exercise 6 Sample Solution

```{r,  out.width = 500, out.height=300}
 average_price_table %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = date, y = mean_price) + 
	geom_line()
```

## Exercise 7

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

current_table <- calendar %>% 
	filter(!is.na(price), 
		   date < lubridate::today(),
		   date > lubridate::mdy('6/1/2016')) %>%
	group_by(listing_id) %>% 
	summarise(last_active = max(date))

recent_listings <- listings %>% 
	left_join(current_table, by = c('id' = 'listing_id')) %>% 
	filter(last_active > lubridate::mdy('6/1/2016'))

summary_table <- recent_listings %>% 
	mutate(price = price %>% gsub('\\$|', '',.) %>% as.numeric(),
		   price_per = price / accommodates,
		   weekly_price = weekly_price %>% gsub('\\$|', '',.) %>% as.numeric(),
		   weekly_price_per = weekly_price / accommodates)  %>% 
	group_by(neighbourhood, property_type) %>% 
	summarize(n = n(), 
			  mean_rating = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
			  price_per = mean(price_per, na.rm = TRUE),
			  weekly_price_per = mean(weekly_price_per, na.rm = T),
			  capacity = sum(beds)) %>% 
	ungroup()
```

Using the `summary_table` object you created earlier, make a bar chart showing the number of **apartments** by neighbourhood. In this case, the correct `geom` to use is `geom_bar(stat = 'identity')`. 

## Exercise 7 Sample Solution {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 500, out.height = 300}
summary_table %>% 
	filter(property_type == 'Apartment') %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = neighbourhood, y= n) + 
	geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

## Let's Clean This Up a Bit {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.width = 500, out.height = 300}
summary_table %>% 
	filter(property_type == 'Apartment') %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	###<b>
	aes(x = reorder(neighbourhood, n), y=n) + 
	coord_flip() + 
	###</b>
	geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

# Comparisons: Fill, Color, and Facets

## From Exercise 7 {.smaller}
```{r, warning = FALSE,  out.width = 500, out.height=300}
summary_table %>% 
	ggplot() + 
	###<b>
	aes(x = reorder(neighbourhood, n), y=n, fill = property_type) + 
	###</b>
	coord_flip() + 
	geom_bar(stat = 'identity') 
```

## From Our First Plot {.smaller}
```{r, warning = FALSE,  out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	filter(number_of_reviews < 100) %>%
	ggplot() + 
	### <b>
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating, color = property_type) + 
	### </b>
	geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
	theme_bw() + 
	labs(x='Number of Reviews', y='Review Score', title='Review Volume and Review Quality') 
```

## From Our First Plot {.smaller}
```{r, warning = FALSE,  out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	filter(number_of_reviews < 100) %>%
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = number_of_reviews, y = review_scores_rating, color = property_type) + 
	geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
	theme_bw() + 
	### <b>
	facet_wrap(~property_type) + 
	### </b>
	labs(x='Number of Reviews', y='Review Score', title='Review Volume and Review Quality') 
```

## Optional: Score Types {.smaller}

```{r, warning = FALSE,  out.width = 500, out.height=300}
listings %>% 
	select(number_of_reviews, contains("review_scores"), - review_scores_rating) %>% 
	###<b> 
	gather(key = type, value = score, -number_of_reviews) %>% 
	###</b> 
	ggplot() + 
	aes(x = factor(score), y = number_of_reviews) + 
	geom_boxplot() + 
	facet_wrap(~type)
```

# Mini-Project

## Project Description

We are going to make a simple business intelligence (BI) dashboard for AirBnB, using the wrangling and visualization skills we have developed in this session. You will use this dashboard to lead a meeting with decision-makers on where to prioritize host recruitment efforts. 

[Example Output](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/wrangle_viz/dashboard.html)

## Instructions {.smaller}

1. Open `wrangle_viz/dashboard.Rmd`
2. Click the `knit` button at the top of RStudio and observe the result. If you see a dashboard, then are good to go. 
3. Modify the dashboard: 
	- Include your names in the `author` metadata up top
	- Write code for data preparation and visualizations as appropriate. You should aim to include a main visualization and a supporting one. 
	- Include all your code in the `R` "code chunks" that begin with ````{r}`
	- Add commentary in the indicated area
4. `knit` your final dashboard one last time and place it in the shared Dropbox folder (link in email)
5. **FILL OUT FEEDBACK SURVEY** (link in email)
6. **Resources:** `R` graphics [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf), [`R` Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
