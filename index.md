title: MBAn Software Workshops
---

Welcome to MIT! Through the Fall and IAP terms, we will host several short workshops intended to build your skills with some fundamental software tools for learning from and solving problems with large data sets. This website hosts the materials for these workshops. The easiest way to obtain these materials is to *fork* this website in GitHub and then *clone* the result to your personal computer. You'll learn what these words mean and how to do them in our first session. 


# Orientation: Data Science in `R` and Optimization in Julia

In our first two days, we will learn how to perform data analysis in `R` and solve optimization problems using `Julia`. 

## Preassignment

**You must complete the [preassignment](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/preassignments/preassignment1/index.html) prior to the session.** In this preassignment, you will install and configure version control tools (`git` and GitHub); data analysis tools (`R` and RStudio); and optimization tools (Julia, JuMP, and Gurobi). We will use all of these tools extensively during our time together. 

Please note that this first preassignment is especially long: plan to allow 2 hours to complete the entire preassignment, and get started **at least two days** prior to the beginning of the session. **We will not be troubleshooting software installation issues during class time.**
