```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
## What Is Data Science?

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width = "400px", out.height = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5150aec6e4b0e340ec52710a/t/51525c33e4b0b3e0d10f77ab/1364352052403/Data_Science_VD.png?format=1500w')

## The Data Scientific Process

## Why Not Spreadsheets? {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, out.height = "440px", out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics('http://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/tables/excel-table.png')
```

- **Flexibility:** Can you do the analysis you want?
	- Limited statistics
	- No contemporary ML
	- Limited visualizations
- **Reproducibility:** Can you share it with others?
	- Platform limited 
	- Can't version control
	- Difficult to inspect code
- **Scalability:** Can you do it quickly on large data sets? 
	- Excel can handle ~1M rows

</div>


## Why Statistical Programming? {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, out.height = "460px", out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://img.tutorialgateway.org/2016/11/R-ggplot2-Jitter-8.png')
```


- **Flexibility:** Can you do the analysis you want?
	- "There's a package for that"
	- Access to cutting-edge methods
	- Custom analysis and visualization
- **Reproducibility:** Can you share it with others?
	- Cross-platform, often FOSS 
	- Can version-control with `git`
	- Easy to inspect code
- **Scalability:** Can you do it quickly on large data sets? 
	- `R` and `python` can work with ~10M rows easily, lots of solutions for larger data sets

</div>

## Why `R`?

```{r}
# knitr::include_graphics('https://www.activestate.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_image/public/r-vs-python-blog.jpg?itok=SHOP2mku')
```

- `R` is **the best** language in the world for **learning** data science.
- `R` is **one of the best** languages in the world for **doing** data science. 
- `R` is best-in-class on data wrangling, visualization, and reproducibility.
- `python` is arguably stronger on machine learning and production deployment.
- `R` tends to be preferred in academia and among "statisticians," while `python` is more popular among "computer scientists" and "data scientists"
- Most practicing data scientists know and use both. 

## Some Cool `R` Tricks

- [Literate Documents](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_nyt_home_price/)
- [These slides]() are written in `RMarkdown`, a language for literate programming
- [Interactive Dashboards](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/genome_browser/) with Shiny
- [More Dashboards](http://jkunst.com/flexdashboard-highcharter-examples/pokemon/)
- [Blogs and Websites](https://philchodrow.github.io/2017/06/19/info-segregation-2/)


## Goals for Today

> - You are not going to become an `R` expert in one day
> - But...
> - You will know **basic concepts** and **vocabulary** of data science, and **how to get help** when you're lost. 

## The Most Useful Programming Skill
