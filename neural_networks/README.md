# Overview
This directory contains all of the files needed for the 15.003 Neural Networks course. I will provide brief descriptions for each file.

## File Descriptions
Any .R file with "_live" indicates that this is the script that will be used during the live coding session. Students should use this
to follow along with the lecture.

All of the .pdf files and .Rmd files are final notes that I will use to help me give the lecture as well as provide as answers for the 
exercises. Students may follow along using these notes, but are discouraged from looking at the exercise answers.

The .pptx file contains the slides that will be used to augment the lecture and also contain some additional mathematical background for those
who are interested.

Finally, load_skin_data.R and submission_helper.R are helper functions that I have written to be used for the Kaggle competition.
These can be read into the R environment by either using the source() command or just copy-pasting the functions from their scripts.

## Jupyter Notebooks
For those who are unable to install keras on R (sometimes there are installation issues; it is a newer package) you can still follow
along with the lecture via the Jupyer notebooks in the repository. To do this, you will need to use Python with an Anaconda installation.
To install Keras on your local machine, execute the following command:

`conda install keras`

This should install all of the requisite packages needed to use the code that I have provided in the Jupyter notebooks.
