    "Our problem involves transporting supply from suppliers to consumers, for example shipping products from factories to retail locations. Let there be $m$ suppliers and $n$ consumer. Each supplier $i = 1, \\ldots, m$ has a supply of $s_i$ units, and each consumer $j = 1, \\ldots, n$ has demand $d_j$. The cost of transporting one unit of supply from supplier $i$ to consumer $j$ is given by $c_{ij}$.\n",
