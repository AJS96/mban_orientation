    "Consider the simple knapsack problem. Iain wants to carry items to the pawn shop to get some extra cash. He has $N$ items, each with a weight $w_i$ and a price $p_i$. Iain hasn't been to the gym lately, so he can only carry $C$ kilos. How does he choose what to bring with him?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model this as an integer optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\max& \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i x_i \\\\\n",

    "& x_i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\quad \\forall i = 1,\\ldots,N\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you solve this? The simple way is just to consider each possible value for $x$ and compare the cost. After Iain has weighed all $2^N$ possible collections of items (and verified that he can lift them at once), he just chooses the best set. If $N$ is large though, this could take a while (or even forever!)\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixed-integer solver is able to solve this problem to provable optimality very fast (much faster than forever) without having to check all possible solutions. How? It explores possible solutions and keeps track of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best solution found so far\n",
    "- A bound on the best possible solution value\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these two pieces of information, the solver can avoid checking certain solutions if it knows they won't help.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have found a knapsack solution with value \\$10. We now know that we can ignore any solution if it can't go higher than \\$10. If the total value of all items is \\$20 and we have excluded more than \\$10 of value from the solution, we don't need to enumerate this line of solutions any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use MIP solvers without knowing how they work, but having some sense of what's going on inside the solver helps to understand your problem better, and especially figure out how \"difficult\" it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve our simple knapsack problem for Iain and see what the solver spits out."
