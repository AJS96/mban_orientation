# Introduction to Optimization
*Instructors: Jack Dunn and Daisy Zhuo*

This is the repository for a day-long intensive crash-course on optimization and `Julia`. 

The course aims to familiarize students with the concept and implementation of optimization. The course outline is as follow:


1. Introduction to Optimization 
    1. General Optimization
    2. Linear Optimization
2. Overview of Optimization in Practice
    1. Optimization Solvers
    2. Algebraic Modeling Languages 
3. Intro to Julia

*Break*

4. Intro to JuMP
5. Guide to MIO modeling and solvers


# Software
We will be using the following software tools duing the class:
1.	`Julia` - the programming language.
2.	`IJulia` - a popular environment for writing and sharing Julia code.
3.	`Gurobi` â€“ a powerful commercial optimization solver
4.	`JuMP` - a package for Julia that lets you express optimization models (together with a number of other Julia packages which we will use).


# Prerequisites and Preassignment

This training does not require any specific theoretical background. To participate in the session, please make sure that you complete the [preassignment](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/mban_orientation/raw/master/optimization_intro/preassignment/optimization-preassignment.pdf) beforehand.
