    "# Finding Anagrams\n",
    "We will apply the tools we have learned thus far to write code to a spelling puzzle. According to Wikipedia, an Anagram is defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An anagram is word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into \"nag a ram\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the dataset of common English words, we want to write a function to find anagrams. Specifically, we want a function `Anagrams()` that returns a list of lists, where each inner list has the words which are anagrams of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `anagrams = Anagrams()`, then `anagrams` should contain the list `[art,rat,tar]`, since art, rat, and tar are in the word list and are mutually anagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: the letters in a string can be sorted via the function `sorted()`.\n"
