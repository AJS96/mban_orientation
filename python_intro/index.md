# Set-up Instructions

## Session Materials

You can [download](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/mban_orientation/archive/master.zip) all the course materials as a `.zip` file.


The instructions for Thursday's class are as follows:
* Please navigate to https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and download Python 2.7 version of Anaconda. 
* After installation, open Anaconda and launch Jupyter notebook 5.0.0.
* Either a browser should open automatically, or a terminal will open. Follow the instructions on the terminal. 
* Once you see a Jupyter screen in your browser, click New -> Python 2 to open a new Python notebook.
* Install the 'pyomo' package by running the code `!pip install pyomo --user` in a cell.
* That is it! Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Brad, Jack and Daisy
