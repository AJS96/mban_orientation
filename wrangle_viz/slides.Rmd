# Introduction

## What We'll Do This Morning

- Work with real and interesting data
- Create appealing and informative visualizations
- Draw useful conclusions

[*David Robinson*](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)

## Why Data Preparation?

## The 80/20 Rule

## FYI: Base `R`

## The Tidyverse

> - "Programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute" - [Hal Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson)

The Tidyverse is a set of packages that promote code which is: 

- Easy to read and write
- Highly performant
- Consistent across the data science workflow

**When you master the Tidyverse, you spend more time thinking about your problem and less time thinking about your code.** 

# Data Wrangling 

## "So your data is..."

- Incomplete
- Inconsistent
- In many pieces
- "Shaped funny"
- ...







# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`

## Graphical Excellence

> Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data -- a matter of *substance*, of *statistics*, and of *design*. 

> Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. -- *Edward Tufte*

## Visualization Problems are Wrangling Problems

> "In my experience, the vast majority of graphing agony is due to insufficient data wrangling." - [Jenny Bryan](http://stat545.com/cm006_tibbles-dplyr-ggplot2.html)
